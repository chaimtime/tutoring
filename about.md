My name is Dr. Haim Cohen, and I've been a public school teacher since 2005. Since 2011, I've been teaching at East Brunswick High School growing the computer science department. The department is now 3 teachers strong. One of my guiding principles is that I believe that all students can be successful at computer science. 

# Courses Taught

I have written all the curriculums (AP Audit Approved), and are currently teaching the following courses.

1. AP Computer Science A
2. AP Computer Science CSP
3. Cybersecurity Honors - An introductory cybersecurity course that follows the Sec+ course objectives.

 Introduction to Comptuer Science in Java - I can no longer teacher due to increased growth in the other courses, however, I still advise the other teachers.



# After School

1. Code Club, a computer science club that participates in programming competitions, as well as security challenges. Our major event is Hour of Code, where we have many hands on demonstrations encouraging everyone to learn to code.

2. Younger Grades: I am expanding my teaching to a local private school, where I teach 4th and 8th graders the basics of programming.
