I"ð<p>My name is Haim Cohen, and Iâ€™ve been a public school teacher since 2005. Since 2011, Iâ€™ve been teaching at East Brunswick High School growing the computer science department. The department is now 3 teachers strong. One of my guiding principles is that I believe that all students can be successful at computer science. In our program we have increased the number of Women and BIPOC students to almost 50%.</p>
